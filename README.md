# houseOfCommonsVotesIllustrations
D3 illustration of the indicative votes of the House of Commons



## Methodology

We construct a bipartite network in which nodes represent either members of the house of commons or one of the eight indicative vote options (`motions`). Nodes are connected by an edge if a given member of parliament voted in favour of this motion.

Note: Members that did not vote in favour of a single motion are not included.
