## Methodology

We construct a bipartite network in which nodes represent either members of the house of commons or one of the eight indicative vote options (so-called motions). Nodes are connected by an edge if a given member of parliament voted in favour of this motion.

Note: Members that did not vote in favour of a single motion are not included.

This is a quick-and-dirty code, so absolutely no guarantee for the correctness of this illustration.
